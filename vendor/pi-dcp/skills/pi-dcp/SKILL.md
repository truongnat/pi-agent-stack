# pi-dcp — Dynamic Context Pruning

`pi-dcp` is a pi extension that reduces token spend in long sessions through three mechanisms:

1. **Automatic deduplication** — When the same tool is called with the same arguments more than once, only the latest output is sent to the LLM. Older duplicates are replaced with `[pruned by pi-dcp: duplicate ... call]`.
2. **Errored input purging** — Tool calls that errored out have their *inputs* stripped after `strategies.purgeErrors.turns` turns (default: 4). The error message is preserved so the model can still recover; only the (often huge) failed payload is removed.
3. **LLM-callable `compress` tool** — The model can decide to summarize closed work-streams into a lossless technical summary. The summary replaces the original tool outputs on the next LLM request.

## When to call `compress`

Call `compress(toolCallIds, topic, summary)` when:

- A discovery phase is finished (initial repo scan, finding the bug location) and you no longer need the raw `grep`/`read` output.
- A long failing retry loop has been resolved and the verbose failures are no longer informative.
- A logically closed sub-task is complete and you can move on with just the conclusions.

**Never compress** the most recent turn, in-flight work, or anything containing facts the user just asked about. Compressions preserve only what is in the `summary` argument — be terse but lossless on file paths, line numbers, errors, and decisions.

## Slash commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/dcp` | Show command list |
| `/dcp context` | Current session token usage + DCP savings + active compressions |
| `/dcp stats` | Cumulative lifetime DCP savings across all sessions |
| `/dcp sweep [n]` | Stage a compression over the last `n` tool results (default: since last user msg) |
| `/dcp manual [on\|off\|toggle\|status]` | Control runtime manual mode (edit config to persist) |
| `/dcp decompress <id>` | Temporarily restore a compression's original tool outputs |
| `/dcp recompress <id>` | Re-apply a previously decompressed entry |

## Configuration

Defaults are auto-written to `~/.pi-dcp/config.json` on first run. Per-project overrides go in `<repo>/.pi/dcp.json`. Restart pi (or `/reload`) after changes.

Notable knobs:

- `compress.mode` — `"message"` (default; LLM lists individual toolCallIds) or `"range"` (LLM gives start+end and we resolve the span).
- `compress.minContextLimit` / `compress.maxContextLimit` — soft floor/ceiling. Below the floor: no nudge. Between floor and ceiling: soft nudge in system prompt. At/above ceiling: hard nudge. Accepts a number or `"X%"` of the model's context window.
- `compress.modelMinLimits` / `modelMaxLimits` — per-model overrides keyed by `"<provider>/<id>"`.
- `compress.permission` — `"allow"` (default), `"ask"`, or `"deny"` (tool not registered at all).
- `compress.nudgeForce` — `"soft"` (gentle wording) or `"strong"` (aggressive wording) for the in-window nudge.
- `compress.nudgeFrequency` (per-fetch) and `compress.nudgeEveryTurns` (per-turn) — stacked throttles for the soft/strong nudge.
- `compress.iterationNudgeThreshold` — fire an iteration nudge after N non-user messages since the last user message, even below the context floor. 0 disables.
- `turnProtection.enabled` / `turns` — the last N user-bounded turns are immune to ALL pruning. The compress tool also REFUSES UPFRONT if its targets land inside this window.
- `manualMode.enabled` / `automaticStrategies` — silence the LLM compress tool and optionally also skip dedup/purge. Stored compressions still apply.
- `experimental.customPrompts` — honor user overrides in `prompts/overrides/{soft-nudge,strong-nudge,hard-nudge,iteration-nudge,compress-message,compress-range}.md`.
- `strategies.deduplication.enabled` / `strategies.purgeErrors.enabled` — independent on/off switches.
- `*.protectedTools` — additional tool names that must never be pruned (e.g. custom write/edit tools).

## Guardrails (always on)


`compress`, `write`, `edit`, `todo`, `task`, and `skill` are *never* deduplicated or purged. Their outputs are also appended verbatim when included in a compression range.
